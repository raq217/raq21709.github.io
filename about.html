            <h1>Who am I?</h1>
            <p>Hello, my name is Rashid Al Qubaisi and I am currently a Junior at NYUAD.</p>
            <p>I am majoring in Economics and Interactive Media, which is why I took Comm lab.</p>
            <p>At the start of the semester I barely had any knowledge in the field of coding.</p>
            <p>This was seen in my first project of the 30 second video showcase where my</p>
            <p>skills and abilities were very limited.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Progressing into the semester I developed some javascript skills with the comic</p>
            <p>project, implementing some animations and interactive techniques for the audience.</p>
            <p>We then moved to the Audio Project which comprised of us recording actual video content</p>
            <p>along with using Audacity, which can be seen on the projects page.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For our final project myself along with my team mates developed a company called "LSFR". </p>
            <p>With this project we had to come up with video content and a coded shop for our audience</p>
            <p>to watch and pre-order. Personally I do hope you take your time to visit this project</p>
            <p>as a lot of time and effort was put into it.</p>
            <br>
